### Hi there 😄 I'm Lu Valcke, I'm from Colombia... 

I'm 32 and have a little princes 👸🏻 called Antho. Years ago my little family began to fall apart, 
since then I had to take on the tasks 🤹‍♀️ of being the head of the house 🏡, mom 🤰🏻, father 👨🏻, daughter 👧🏻 and many more that doesn't fit in hear. 
Since there my need to improve and create agile 🏃🏻‍♀️ processes that helps me to fulfill tasks and achieve goals ✔️ in an optimal way was born. 
Passionate about cinema 📽️, audiovisual media 📺 and technology 👩🏻‍💻, now a front-end developer with the desire and skills necessaries to take over the world 🌎.
